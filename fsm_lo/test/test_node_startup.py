The contract a freshly started node honours, once.

These three properties are about a node that has never been started and has
never seen a scan, so they need an untouched node and cannot share one with the
other behaviour tests. They live in their own launch for that reason: the whole
file is a single test, so nothing can have disturbed the node before it runs.
