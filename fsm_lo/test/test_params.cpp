 * Settings that cannot work, and what the package says about them.
 *
 * The published version checked these with assertions, which do nothing at all
 * in a release build and abort the process in any other. Neither is any use to
 * somebody who has mistyped a number in a configuration file. The check now
 * returns a sentence naming the setting, and the node refuses to start and
 * prints it.
 *
 * Every case below asserts that the sentence names the setting that is wrong,
 * because a refusal that does not say which of sixteen numbers is at fault is
 * barely better than the assertion it replaced.
