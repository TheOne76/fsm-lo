 * Where a ray leaving a pose meets the walls of a room.
 *
 * Everything the matcher does rests on this: a scan is turned into points, the
 * points are turned back into ranges from a hypothesised pose, and the two are
 * compared. If the intersection is wrong then every stage above it is working
 * from fiction, and nothing further up would say so clearly.
 *
 * The expected answers here are worked out by hand rather than recorded from a
 * previous run, so they check the geometry rather than check that it has not
 * changed.
 *
 * Ray i of a scan of n rays leaves at i * 2*pi/n + pose orientation - pi. Ray
 * zero therefore points backwards along the pose's own axis, not forwards, and
 * the cases below are indexed with that in mind.
