/*
 * The gate for the modernisation work.
 *
 * Drives the matcher over the same scans the ROS 1 reference build was driven
 * over, and compares against the numbers that build produced. The reference
 * files hold nothing but numbers, so this needs no ROS, no container and no
 * network: it can be run after every single change to the core.
 *
 * A modernisation pass that moves any of these numbers has changed behaviour,
 * whatever it claimed to do.
 *
 *
 * WHAT THE RUNTIME PATH REACHES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
 *
 * This file drives the wrapper, which is the only way the node reaches the
 * core, so every core function the runtime path can reach runs here at least
 * once. Several also have tests of their own elsewhere, against answers worked
 * out by hand rather than recorded.
 *
 * The core header declares seventy three functions. Forty five of them are
 * reachable. The twenty eight below are not: nothing on the path from a scan
 * arriving to a pose being published calls them, directly or at any depth.
 *
 * The list is arrived at rather than guessed. A single translation unit that
 * asks the core for exactly what the wrapper asks it for is compiled with
 * inlining off:
 *
 *   g++ -std=c++23 -O0 -fno-inline -ffunction-sections -c probe.cpp
 *   nm -C --defined-only probe.o | grep FSM::
 *
 * A function is emitted only where something calls it, so what the object file
 * holds is what the runtime path reaches, and the rest of the header is what
 * it does not. Re-run it after any change that adds or removes a call.
 *
 * Recording helpers. They write points, scans, maps and polygons to files for
 * offline inspection, and the node inspects nothing offline:
 *
 *   Dump::convexHulls, Dump::map, Dump::points, Dump::polygon,
 *   Dump::polygons, Dump::rangeScan, Dump::scan, DatasetUtils::printDataset
 *
 * Dataset reading. These belong to the offline driver the algorithm was
 * written around, which reads scans from a file rather than from a sensor:
 *
 *   DatasetUtils::dataset2points, DatasetUtils::dataset2rangesAndPose,
 *   DatasetUtils::readDataset, DatasetUtils::readDatasetScan
 *
 * Scan completion. Six variations on filling in a scan from a hypothesised
 * pose. The matcher completes scans by another route entirely and calls none
 * of them:
 *
 *   ScanCompletion::completeScan, ScanCompletion::completeScan1 through
 *   ScanCompletion::completeScan5
 *
 * Small helpers left behind, each called by nothing:
 *
 *   DFTUtils::fftshift, Rotation::angleById, Utils::generatePoseWithinMap,
 *   Utils::innerProduct, Utils::isPositionFartherThan,
 *   Utils::multiplyWithRotationMatrix, Utils::pairDiff, Utils::sgn,
 *   Utils::vectorDiff
 *
 * One is unreachable on purpose. X::findExact walks every wall for every ray
 * and is the slow, obvious answer the two selectable ray searches are held to
 * in test_geometry.cpp. It is reference material, not dead weight.
 *
 * Of the other twenty seven, only DFTUtils::fftshift has a test. The
 * remaining twenty six are shipped, compiled, and exercised by nothing at all.
 * Deleting them is a decision about how much of the original algorithm this
 * package is obliged to carry, which is why they are listed here rather than
 * removed.
