/*
 * The two stages on their own, on the two trajectories built to isolate them:
 * one that only turns and one that only moves.
 *
 * Neither stage recovers a pose increment on its own, and a test written as
 * though it should would be wrong about the algorithm rather than about the
 * code. The rotation stage answers with whole steps of the scan's angular
 * resolution, halved for each level of magnification, so its answer to a turn
 * that falls between two steps is one of the two. The translation stage
 * corrects a little at a time and needs tens of iterations to arrive. The
 * matcher gets a full answer by alternating them and raising the magnification,
 * which is what the golden comparison exercises end to end.
 *
 * What is pinned here is what each stage is separately responsible for.
 *
 * The scans and the poses that produced them come from the generator, which
 * computes ranges by intersecting rays with a room analytically and shares no
 * code with what is being tested.
